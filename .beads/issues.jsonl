{"id":"am-sar","title":"Sidebar terminal latency (bottom-right pane) - make output feel immediate","description":"**Goal:** Make output feel as immediate as a normal terminal (no 0.5–3s delays).\n\n**Context:**\n- Current sidebar PTY read loop is Bubbletea-driven (one read per tick). Even after removing flush debounce + writing immediately to vterm, output still lags because the **read itself** is throttled by the message loop.\n- A normal terminal drains the PTY continuously in a dedicated loop.\n\n**Likely fix direction:**\n- Replace Bubbletea command-scheduled read with a dedicated goroutine that continuously reads from the PTY and pushes bytes into a channel.\n- In Bubbletea Update, run a lightweight tick (e.g. 16ms) to drain the channel and batch VTerm.Write.\n- Keep vterm writes on UI thread or guard via mutex; avoid per-message overhead.\n\n**File touchpoints:**\n- internal/ui/sidebar/terminal.go","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-01T16:50:48.204296-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-02T16:07:18.873393-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T16:07:18.873393-08:00","created_by":"andrewlee"}

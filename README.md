Here are some reasons why you would use amux over others:
* Use coding agents directly (i.e. Claude Code, Codex CLI). There's no new coding agent, wrapper, or SDK involved.
* Supports all of the major coding agents: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, OpenCode.
* Navigate with keyboard only using vim inspired shortcuts.
* Run it on the terminal.
* Open source.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyrewlee/amux.git
cd amux
go build -o amux ./cmd/amux
./amux
```

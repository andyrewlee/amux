cd amux
make run
```

Run the local checks that mirror CI:

```bash
make devcheck
```

## Release

Versioning follows SemVer and tags are `vX.Y.Z`. Pushing a tag triggers the GitHub Actions release job.

Fast path:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
make release VERSION=v0.0.5
```

Manual steps:

```bash
make release-check
git tag -a v0.0.5 -m "v0.0.5"
git push origin v0.0.5
```

Notes:

- `make release` runs `release-check`, creates an annotated tag, and pushes it. The worktree must be clean.
- Release builds use the commit timestamp for `main.date`, which keeps the timestamp deterministic for a given commit. If you need strict bit-for-bit reproducibility, consider adding `-trimpath` and a stable build ID to the build flags.

### Homebrew tap

The Homebrew tap lives in `andyrewlee/homebrew-amux` and auto-bumps the formula after a release.

- After `make release VERSION=vX.Y.Z`, the tap workflow updates `Formula/amux.rb` (daily at 06:00 UTC).
- To update immediately, run the **Bump amux formula** workflow in the tap repo.
- Users upgrade with `brew upgrade amux`.
